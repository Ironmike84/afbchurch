We believe worshiping God is a journey that changes us from the inside out. As followers of Jesus Christ, we desire to make worship a part of our everyday lives. Our worship services are prayerfully designed to inspire encounters with God that will bring us deeper into our walk with him. Nursery is provided for infants, and Toddlers.  Children's Worship is offered for Ages Pre-school - 3rd Grade during Sunday Morning Worship</p>
